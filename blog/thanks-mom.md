A few months ago, I finally merged all of my old blog posts into this website, from 2002 onwards. Nearly all of them are terrible and hidden from public view.

I've been steadily reviewing every one to find the exceptions. They are few, but this paragraph from [a post in late 2005](/post/proliferating-propagating-promulgating) stuck out:

> I was talking with my mother on the phone recently, and I was rather taken aback when, during our phone conversation, I mentioned that I'd been steadily upgrading my wardrobe, and she suddenly burst into gales of involuntarily laughter.  She continued to laugh and laugh, until eventually she started choking from laughing so much.  So she kept choking for a little while, and when she finally recovered she continued laughing some more.  I asked her what was so funny, and she said that, well, with my wardrobe, the only direction I could really go was up.  Then she kept giggling for a while as I tried to keep talking to her.

[The post](/post/proliferating-propagating-promulgating) also mentioned the then-new burrito chain Boloco, whose CEO at the time posted two comments, including one about the birth of his child.

My wardrobe is pretty much the same.
