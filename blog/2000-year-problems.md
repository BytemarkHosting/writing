I want to work on the next 2,000 years. It's such a long time. Just about anything with a capitalized name along the way — from a sports team to a nation — doesn't really matter on that scale.

For me, there are three things I could comfortably devote my life to:

**Neuroscience**. Understanding the nature and power of the human brain in a complete and objective manner. Everything we do and feel, everything we believe is true, is produced by this. It is a science in its infancy.

**Space exploration**. The spread of [life rational](/post/life-rational). Nothing is more important to the universe than keeping around the ability to perceive it. We seem to have trouble [devoting proportionate resources](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/04/11/nasa_budget_increase_for_asteroids_cuts_for_planets_and_education.html) to the field.

**Individual empowerment**. The personal belief and reality that you have control, can improve your world, and are more important than institutions. A tenuous concept that takes real work to spread, and is utterly opposed by nearly every institution of force and history.

There are other important things! Genetics: pretty crazy. Climate change: permanent ramifications. Art: essential in the literal sense. I deeply respect their 2,000-year nature, they just don't excite me as much. And there's no way I'll even have time to make a meaningful contribution to each of the things that do.

But this is how I measure and re-measure my work. When my name is forgotten, will I still be there, as part of something so vast it is perceived simply as the arc of history?
