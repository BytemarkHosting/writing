I recently got a chance to go speak to [a group of Arizona law librarians](http://www.aallnet.org/chapter/azll/) about legal informatics! I do not think that I would have guessed this future of myself back in college, but it's real and it's now, and it was actually a lot of fun.

They found me because of [Scout](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com/), and asked me to talk about tracking government information. I decided to start with Scout as an example, to zoom out to [similar](http://www.govtrack.us/) [projects](http://courtlistener.com/), and then to describe the conditions necessary to make projects like ours possible. Because the audience was law librarians, a sympathetic crowd inside an [unsympathetic](/assets/images/pacer-terms.png) area of government, I emphasized the necessity of absolutely free access to data as a fundamental requirement and right.

They asked me to send over materials that could be, like, printed - like on paper - to give to attendees for legal credit. Bewildered, I decided to do a sort of active outline, and drafted it in GitHub's [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) before converting it to a print-ready version (links -> footnotes). I actually really like how it turned out - it's not a bad tour over the space I work in and how me and my emotions fit into it. So here it is below, embedded directly [from Gist](https://gist.github.com/konklone/5278942). [right I also made a [list of links](https://gist.github.com/konklone/5468803) of the 40-odd tabs I had open in my browser for the actual talk.]
