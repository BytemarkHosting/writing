I had just a wonderful time at DC Legal Hackers' [first ever hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/131894852/) last Saturday. Founded by [Rebecca Williams](https://twitter.com/internetrebecca), [Jameson Dempsey](https://github.com/jamesondempsey), and [Alan deLevie](https://twitter.com/adelevie), the DC group is juuuust starting out, and inspired by the successful [New York Legal Hackers group](http://www.meetup.com/legalhackers/). 

You can see some nice pictures of the event rounded up on [the Open Gov Foundation blog](http://opengovfoundation.tumblr.com/post/63569079653/dc-legal-hackers-inaugural-hackathon-october-5), and details (including [spreadsheets...of tweets!](http://personal.psu.edu/rcr5122/DCLegalHackersLegalHackathonOct2013Tweets.csv)[right spreadtweets.]) on the [Legal Informatics Blog](http://legalinformatics.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/5-october-2013-dc-legal-hackathon/). The event was kindly hosted by [Fastcase](http://fastcase.com).

I was just a participant, so I probably missed a bunch of stuff, but some neat things I saw occur:

* David Zvenyach, chief lawyer for the DC Council, continued his personal transformation into a role model for government lawyers everywhere by working on a [Python scraper for DC's procurement contracts](https://github.com/vzvenyach/dc-contracts). In case you forgot, Zvenyach is also the one responsible, on the government side, for [opening the DC Code](http://macwright.org/2013/04/04/the-open-code.html) back in April.
* The team at the Open Gov Foundation forked [StackEdit](http://benweet.github.io/stackedit/) to devise a Markdown-based format for legal drafting. Alan deLevie wrote a tool to [autolink legal citations](https://github.com/adelevie/citation-linker) inside it, using my [unitedstates/citation](https://github.com/unitedstates/citation) parser as a foundation.
* The Legal Services Corporation ([lsc.gov](http://www.lsc.gov/)) showed up and worked on [using maps](https://github.com/LegalServicesCorporation/LSC-Mapping) to make its legal service delivery more effective.
* The organizers inducted a bunch of people into using GitHub by getting them working on a little GitHub-powered [website for the DC Legal Hackers group itself](http://dclegalhackers.github.io/).
* Ben Balter sat for 2 hours fixing terrifically arcane JavaScript bugs so that the White House [may some day again accept pull requests](https://github.com/prose/prose/pull/614) on its open data guidance.
* I got momentum on my project to make a friendly, public domain [glossary for the United States](https://github.com/unitedstates/glossary), with help from [Lindsay Young](https://twitter.com/not_young), [Erroll Grannum](https://github.com/errolgrannum), and [@keith5000](https://github.com/keith5000). Seamus Kraft recorded [a video of me presenting]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlmDEDNV7d0&feature=youtu.be) about it at the day's end.

A productive day all around, and a great piece of community bonding. The plan is for DCLH to run a hackathon every quarter, so another's not far off. In the meantime, next up is [a night of drinks and talks about increasing basic access to legal services](http://www.meetup.com/DCLegalHackers/events/142943202/). DC is a more interesting place to work in technology every year, and things like DC Legal Hackers make me feel like I'm in the right place at the right time.
