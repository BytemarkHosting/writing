Look, I don't really know a hell of a lot about <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a>.  It's not even enabled in my Gmail account yet. (Though I can "see the buzz" around places in my new Google Maps update for my Android phone.)  But, a few things are pretty plain to me.

People comparing it to <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> or <a href="http://yelp.com">Yelp</a> and declaring it a ripoff are missing the boat.  It doesn't compete with either of those.  The thing it's closest to is <a href="http://friendfeed.com,">Friendfeed</a> but honestly Friendfeed has never appealed to me, as Yet Another Thing To Track.

Google Buzz may have the same problems, but it's just going to do a lot better because it's right there.  Did people complain when Google launched GTalk inside Gmail, and complain about it "ripping off" AIM, or fragmenting the busy IM market?  No, people just started using it, and now more of my friends are on GTalk than are not.

The craziest thing about Google Buzz, the thing that I'm the most excited about, despite not having actually *used* it yet, is this:

Look at that fucking lefthand sidebar.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">Pubsubhubbub</a> ("PuSH"), <a href="http://www.salmon-protocol.org/,">Salmon</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/,">Webfinger</a> and <a href="http://oauth.net/.">OAuth</a>  OAuth is starting to take off on its own, largely thanks to Twitter, but the other three are much different. PuSH, Salmon, and Webfinger have all been flying under a lot of people's radars, but they represent the future of the web.  They are open, decentralized, and contain all the lessons we as an Internet have learned over the past 10 years.

Gist of each: 

* <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">Pubsubhubbub</a> notifies subscribers when you post something to the Internet, unlike RSS where subscribers have to keep checking. PuSH makes things travel around the Internet instantly, and flips a fundamental assumption about the Web - that you post something and then wait for people to discover it - on its head.
* <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">Webfinger</a> is a bit like OpenID, but around your email instead of a URL, which is way easier for people to understand. It's also more powerful; you can connect other services (like <a href="http://openid.net)">OpenID</a> to it.
* <a href="http://www.salmon-protocol.org/">Salmon</a> is the other half of Pubsubhubbub, for comments. This is newer to me, and less revolutionary, but solves the problems I was having when thinking about how to get PuSH to work in both directions for articles and comments for my new blog, and realizing PuSH wasn't ideal for comments.

I wish I'd written about them here before; I've <a href="http://mill-industries.com/post/329-yearling">already been planning</a> on doing Pubsubhubbub integration with my new website, which I'm working on actively, and which will replace this site entirely.  In fact, part of that plan has also been to aggregate all my activity elsewhere, Friendfeed/Buzz-style (but optimized for me). I feel validated in that plan now, and extra motivated to carry it out.

With every open standard we adopt, with every decentralized protocol we weave into our communication, the Internet becomes more resilient, more intelligent, and harder to oppress.  Even if Google Buzz becomes a flop like Wave seems to be, if it gives Webfinger and Pubsubhubbub the boost they need to see mainstream adoption, then all of our futures will be brighter for it.
