If you have a PayPal account, you may have gotten an email from them - they've <a href="http://consumerist.com/2012/10/09/paypal-slips-forced-arbitration-clause-into-user-agreement-gives-you-until-dec-1-to-opt-out/">updated their terms of service</a> to remove your right to participate in a class action lawsuit against them, unless you send a formal and precisely formatted letter to their legal department "opting out" of their removal of your rights.

Public Citizen has <a href="http://consumerist.com/2012/10/15/here-is-a-downloadable-template-for-opting-out-of-paypal-arbitration-clause/">designed a template</a> (specifically, a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/paypal-arbitration-opt-out-letter.docx">DOCX file</a>) you can add your name/phone/email address to, print, <strong>sign</strong>, and mail to them. I'm doing it. Don't forget about filling one out for <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/ebay-arbitration-opt-out-letter.docx">eBay too</a>, due on Nov 9.

There's also a classy "<a href="http://www.citizen.org/rigged-justice-rogues-gallery">rogues gallery</a>", also done by Public Citizen, that lists other companies that have added these clauses to their terms. Everyone from Papa John's pizza to your local nursing home. Truly grotesque.
