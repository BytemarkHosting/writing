Visit <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> today and you'll see they blacked out their logo, and added a link to their <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/takeaction/">anti-SOPA/PIPA</a> campaign. Cool. Not quite as strong a move as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia shutting off their entire English site</a>, but, fine.

Except that everyone else is asking people to call their Congressperson. Instead, Google is asking you to sign an online petition. This is a huge letdown.

Online petitions do not affect national political discourse. Maybe <a href="http://change.org">Change.org</a> is helping local campaigns get traction, I don't know, but their and everyone else's national campaigns are for show. They're building organizations' email lists.

In fact, a study by the <a href="http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/perceptions-of-citizen-advocacy-on-capitol-hill">Congressional Management Foundation</a> that surveyed Congressional staff found that over 50% of them thought that "most advocacy campaigns of identical form messages are sent without constituents' knowledge or approval". Not just that they don't have much impact - the majority of Congressional staff assume form messages from citizens are <strong>meaningless lies</strong>.

Calls, on the other hand, get through to offices in a way that emails, contact forms, and even letters do not. The only thing better you can do as a citizen is visit your Congressperson's office in person. Calling and visiting are hard. They're uncomfortable. Fewer people will do them. 

And <strong>that is why they are effective</strong>. By doing it, you convince your Congressperson's office that you mean business, that your vote is in the balance, and that you're probably the sort who'll convince a bunch of other people to hang their votes in the balance too. You're making yourself a representative to your representative.

Email lists can have value - but now is not the moment for making them. This is the moment where, if you've already got one, you <strong>use them</strong> to get people to make calls. 

Google's been a powerful advocate to date in opposing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act">PIPA</a>. Today, they should go the distance, and melt some phone lines.
