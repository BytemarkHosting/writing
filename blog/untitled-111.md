> There was a young man loved a maid<br/>
> Who taunted him.  "Are you afraid,"<br/>
> She asked, "to bring me today<br/>
> Your mother's head upon a tray?"<br/>
> 
> He went and slew his mother dead,<br/>
> Tore from her breast her heart so red,<br/>
> Then toward his lady love he raced,<br/>
> But tripped and fell in all his haste.<br/>
> 
> As the heart rolled on the ground<br/>
> It gave forth a plaintive sound.<br/>
> And it spoke in accents mild:<br/>
> "Did you hurt yourself, my child?"<br/>
