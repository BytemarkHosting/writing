<h2 id="part-three">Part 3: Flipping the Switch</h2>

Now that Pobox has verified and added your domain, you'll see it appear on your [Pobox dashboard]((https://pobox.com/home)):

<img src="/assets/images/domains/pobox-configure-1b.png" class="block upper border" />

Click "Add user" to finally pick your shiny new email address:

<img src="/assets/images/domains/pobox-configure-2.png" class="block upper border" />

And close the deal by pointing it to your current one:

<img src="/assets/images/domains/pobox-configure-3.png" class="block upper border" />

You are finally done! Go ahead and send yourself a test email â€” ideally from an unrelated address, like a work account. If it works, then look at you: **you own your email address**.

<h2 id="using-new-address">Using Your New Address</h2>

Your new address will only matter if it actually gets used in place of your old one. You can certainly email blast everyone you know and tell them to use your new address, but there are quieter ways.

**1. Send email "as" your new address.** Gmail's Settings screen has an Accounts tab that lets you add any email address you own, and make it your default "From" address. Click "Add another email address you own":

<img src="/assets/images/domains/gmail-new-email-1.png" class="block upper border" />

Then enter your new email address in the popup window, and click "Next Step".

<img src="/assets/images/domains/gmail-new-email-2.png" class="block upper border" />

Google will send you a verification link. After you click it, go back to the Accounts settings and click "make default" next to your new email address. This will send emails "as" your new address, and when people reply to you, they'll automatically send it to that new address. This will work your new address into other people's contacts, and over time people should begin to always email your new address.

(You can do similar things with your [Microsoft](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/other-email-accounts) and [Yahoo!](http://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&y=PROD_ACCT&page=content&id=SLN2058) emails. Any other decent email provider should offer you the same option.)

**2. See how it's going.** To test whether that strategy will actually work, I first set up a filter for `to:eric@konklone.com` that auto-labels incoming email as `eric@` and colors them an attractive blue. This gives me a sense, at a glance, of how well my email address transition is going:

<img src="/assets/images/domains/email-label.png" class="block upper border" />

Once the majority of your emails are getting labeled like that, you can reverse the filter so that emails to your **old** address get labeled instead. That way, you can quickly spot outliers and update your information wherever necessary.

**3. Gradually update your online accounts.** It may be obvious, but don't stress out about updating all of your online accounts. It's impossible to remember all of them, and impractical to go update them all at once. It's much easier to make it a habit to go change your email address whenever you end up on a site you have an account with. You'll naturally get the most important ones changed quickly.

**4. (iOS only) Set it up on your phone.** If you use Gmail and an iPhone or iPad, and you use the default Mail app, you can configure it to use your own domain name. Phil Montero at The Anywhere Office has [a video walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0qx_UfsronA) of the process, and a [larger article](http://www.theanywhereoffice.com/digital-lifestyle/how-to-send-mail-from-your-own-domain-using-gmail-and-iphone.htm) that describes it along with some other things.

Thanks to Clayton, who wrote in asking about iPhone support, tried out Phil's video, and has this to share for anyone using it:

> My experience:  You might receive a few error messages at first (when sending test emails), even as the emails are being sent from your iPhone.  For example, your iPhone might tell you that the username or password is incorrect, even as it proceeds to send the emails.  Just give it a few minutes -- everything seems to connect after a while and the error messages stop.

<h2 id="and-hey">And Hey</h2>

It's pretty cool that you really went through and did all of this stuff! I hope you found it worthwhile, maybe even a little eye-opening. You didn't have to be a company or get licensed or anything, and you made a working email address on 100% your own terms.

As you encounter services and companies on the Internet, consider whether they will make you more or less powerful. It's not always an easy question. Companies like [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) and [Pobox](http://pobox.com/) are designed to give you more power: they free you from long term dependency, and they're easy to leave. Not coincidentally, they cost money. But their real market challenge is subtler and dangerous: they require you to learn a couple of concepts about the Internet.

The goal of many other successful Internet companies is to convince you not to bother with all that learning, so that they can be a part of your identity and extract as much value from your daily life as possible. Free services like Twitter and Google offer lots of benefits, and certain kinds of power. But I think we've all felt that uncomfortable gut sensation we get when we see a bad news headline, or a canned product, or really anything that reminds us how much we depend on these free, smiling behemoths and how little control we have over them.

Getting a domain name and sticking it in your email is just a small step towards online independence. There's a lot more you can do. But it is a real step, and you've taken it.
