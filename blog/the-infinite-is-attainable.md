This is awesome: a paper on "single serving sites", on <a href="http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com.">its own single serving site</a>.  The author is <a href="http://ryangreenberg.com,">Ryan Greenberg</a> a student of Information Science at UC Berkeley.  It's a cool paper, written in a pleasant tone that takes you around to many oddities of the net, many of which I never knew about.  Also interesting is <a href="http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com/sss_data.txt">his list</a> of the 130 single serving sites that he used in writing his report.  They're not all YES/NO things - <a href="http://umbrellatoday.com">Umbrella Today</a> makes his list, along with the original <a href="http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com/images/hamster-dance-large.png.">Hamster Dance</a>.

Since I saw <a href="http://isittuesday.com">IsItTuesday</a> pop up 6 days after I "launched" <a href="http://isitchristmas.com,">IsItChristmas</a> I've been watching all the sites that IIC inspired (and who in some cases just copy/pasted my source code), and <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com">there</a> <a href="http://isitbirthday.com/">are</a> <a href="http://hasthelhcdestroyedtheearth.com.">many</a>.  I like to take a little credit for this leading to a paper, and that paper's site following that model.  

And as I am a proud man who enjoys pointing out his accomplishments to others, here is a chart, adapted from <a href="http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com/sss_data.txt,">Ryan's data</a> to back me up:

Number 4 - not bad.  There were 3 in front of me, and though I'd heard of each of them by the time I made IIC, you'll have to take my word that none of them even crossed my mind in providing inspiration.  Along with a coworker's random exclamation, the only site that inspired me was <a href="http://whatismyip.com,">WhatIsMyIP</a> a site I still occasionally make use of.

So there you have it: final proof of the inexpressible value of my birth, and my utter validity as a leader of men.  Now I'm gonna go play video games.
