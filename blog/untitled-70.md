Last few days:

Wednesday:
Got home from work at 7 AM, slept from 9 AM to 1:30 PM
Awake for 6 hours
Slept from 7:30 PM to 10:30 PM
Awake for 1 hour
Slept from 11:30 PM to 6:30 AM
Awake for 25 hours (worked the last 8)
Slept from 8:30 AM to 9 PM
Worked, still awake

Lost all conception of an organized day, the clock means nothing to me except notifying when to go to work.
