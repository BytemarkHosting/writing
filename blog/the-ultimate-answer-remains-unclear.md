It's time for more [irrational fun](/post/isitchristmas-dot-com-2012) with [isitchristmas.com](http://isitchristmas.com) this year. I don't know everything I'm going to do with it this year, but it's going to build on 2012 in a fun way — and also in a more reliable way. 

For example, I had a couple of midnight crashes on the 25th, for the first time ever. They were both embarrassing and cost me tons of traffic, and they will NOT happen again. Really, I just want more people, and for them to have more fun. Nothing too fancy. (Okay, maybe a couple fancy things.)

But first, I've kicked off the holiday season by finally cleaning up and releasing a bunch of isitchristmas DATA:

Maybe most interesting here is the [chat log file](https://github.com/isitchristmas/data/blob/gh-pages/2012/chat.csv), from the "secret" chat room in the developer console. It took me...many hours to clean up the original raw transcript of spam and abuse, through a mix of automation and old-fashioned hand-work.

If you feel like voyeuring my traffic, I also put up some PDF exports from Google Analytics for each year's Christmas time, because why not:

[2007](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2007.pdf) — [2008](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2008.pdf) — [2009](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2009.pdf) — [2010](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2010.pdf) — [2011](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2011.pdf) — [2012](http://isitchristmas.io/data/google-analytics/2012.pdf)

It goes up every year, so obviously I've got to keep it going. Fortunately, it seems like 2013 is already near certain to be much bigger:

I'll be heads-down for the rest of the year working on it, this is pretty much my only side project. If you're interested in helping out with something, [send me an email](mailto:eric@konklone.com) or [show up on GitHub](https://github.com/isitchristmas/web/issues?state=open)!
